# emulator-CH-P-8-interpreter-
An emulator will be created for introduction purposes.

Definition of emulator:
An emulator is a software or hardware system that mimics (or "emulates") another computer system or device. It allows one system (often called the "host") to run software, programs, or games designed for a different system (called the "guest").

What is chip-8 system? 
The CHIP-8 system is a simple, virtual computer from the 1970s designed to help run small games. It is not a physical computer, but rather an interpreted language that was used to run programs (mostly games) on early 8-bit computers.

In this project, an emulator was created using the C++ programming language and the GLUT library to enable playing games like Pong and Tetris.
